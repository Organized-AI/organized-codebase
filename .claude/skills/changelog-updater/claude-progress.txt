=== CLAUDE PROGRESS LOG ===
Project: changelog-updater
Initialized: 2025-01-28
Total Features: 12
Completed: 1

Description:
Interactive changelog update skill that notifies users of Claude Code
updates and helps them understand + apply relevant changes to their workflow.

Key Integration Points:
- changelog-tracker skill (fetches changelog)
- CHANGELOG-STANDARDS.md (defines entry categories)
- settings.json (for config updates)
- AskUserQuestion tool (for interactive prompts)

=== SESSION LOG ===

--- Session 1: 2025-01-28 ---
Duration: ~20 minutes
Work done:
- Created CHANGELOG-STANDARDS.md with category definitions
- Designed structured metadata schema for parsing
- Created skill directory structure
- Created feature_list.json with 12 features
- Created this progress file

Features completed: feat-001 (Skill scaffold and SKILL.md)
Features in progress: None

Next session should:
1. Use subagents to build features in parallel where possible
2. Start feat-002: Changelog diff detection (BLOCKING - others depend on this)
3. Reference CHANGELOG-STANDARDS.md for category markers

=== PARALLELIZATION STRATEGY ===

Phase 1 (Sequential - must complete first):
  └─ feat-002: Changelog diff detection

Phase 2 (Can parallelize after feat-002):
  ├─ Subagent A: feat-003 (Entry parser with category detection)
  └─ Subagent B: feat-005 (Interactive presentation layer - scaffold UI)

Phase 3 (Can parallelize after feat-003):
  ├─ Subagent A: feat-004 (Action type mapper)
  ├─ Subagent B: feat-006 (Config update handler)
  └─ Subagent C: feat-007 (Command demo handler)

Phase 4 (After handlers complete):
  └─ feat-008, feat-009, feat-010, feat-011, feat-012 (integration work)

=== SUBAGENT PROMPTS (for next Claude) ===

To build in parallel, spawn Task agents like:
```
Task(Explore): "Read feat-002 requirements and implement changelog diff detection"
Task(Explore): "Scaffold the interactive presentation layer UI for feat-005"
```

Code is in merge-ready state: YES (planning artifacts only)
Tests passing: N/A (no code yet)

Blockers: None

Context for next Claude:
- The CHANGELOG-STANDARDS.md file defines 7 categories with marker keywords
- Each category maps to an action_type for the interactive system
- Use AskUserQuestion tool for the interactive presentation layer
- The changelog-tracker skill already fetches changelogs - integrate with it
