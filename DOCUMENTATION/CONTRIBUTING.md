## Coding Standards

### General Principles
- **Write clear, readable code** that others can understand
- **Follow existing patterns** and conventions in the codebase
- **Keep functions small** and focused on single responsibilities
- **Use meaningful names** for variables, functions, and classes
- **Write self-documenting code** with minimal but effective comments

### Language-Specific Standards

#### JavaScript/TypeScript
```javascript
// Use const/let instead of var
const userName = 'john_doe';
let userCount = 0;

// Use arrow functions for short functions
const formatName = (first, last) => `${first} ${last}`;

// Use async/await instead of promises when possible
async function fetchUser(id) {
  try {
    const response = await api.get(`/users/${id}`);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch user:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Use TypeScript types for better code quality
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

#### CSS/Styling
```css
/* Use meaningful class names */
.user-profile-card {
  padding: 1rem;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

/* Follow mobile-first responsive design */
.container {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0 1rem;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    padding: 0 2rem;
  }
}
```

### File Organization
- **Group related files** together in directories
- **Use consistent naming** conventions across the project
- **Keep files focused** - one component per file
- **Create index files** for cleaner imports

### Git Commit Guidelines
We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Commit Types
- **feat**: New features
- **fix**: Bug fixes
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without functional changes
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates

#### Examples
```bash
feat(auth): add password reset functionality

fix(api): handle null user data in profile endpoint

docs: update contributing guidelines

style: format code with prettier

refactor(utils): simplify date formatting function

test(auth): add tests for login validation

chore: update dependencies to latest versions
```

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage
- **Minimum coverage**: 80% for new code
- **Critical paths**: 100% coverage for authentication, payment, data integrity
- **Edge cases**: Test error conditions and boundary cases
- **Integration**: Test API endpoints and component interactions

### Testing Types

#### Unit Tests
```javascript
// Example unit test
describe('formatCurrency', () => {
  it('should format USD currency correctly', () => {
    expect(formatCurrency(1234.56, 'USD')).toBe('$1,234.56');
  });

  it('should handle zero values', () => {
    expect(formatCurrency(0, 'USD')).toBe('$0.00');
  });

  it('should throw error for invalid currency', () => {
    expect(() => formatCurrency(100, 'INVALID')).toThrow();
  });
});
```

#### Integration Tests
```javascript
// Example API integration test
describe('POST /api/users', () => {
  it('should create user with valid data', async () => {
    const userData = {
      name: 'John Doe',
      email: 'john@example.com',
      password: 'securePassword123'
    };

    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/users')
      .send(userData)
      .expect(201);

    expect(response.body.user.email).toBe(userData.email);
    expect(response.body.user.password).toBeUndefined();
  });
});
```

#### Component Tests
```javascript
// Example React component test
describe('UserProfile', () => {
  it('should display user information', () => {
    const user = { name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com' };
    
    render(<UserProfile user={user} />);
    
    expect(screen.getByText('John Doe')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('john@example.com')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- UserProfile.test.js

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration
```
