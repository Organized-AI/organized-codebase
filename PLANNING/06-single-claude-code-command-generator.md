# ü§ñ Single Claude Code Command Generator System

## üìã Overview

A systematic approach to automatically generate project-specific, copy-paste ready "Single Claude Code Commands" whenever a user mentions 'one prompt'. This system creates autonomous execution blocks for Claude Code with proper context, token estimates, and machine-specific configurations.

## üéØ Trigger Conditions

The system activates when the user mentions any of these phrases:
- "one prompt"
- "single command"
- "copy paste command"
- "autonomous execution"
- "handoff prompt"

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Context Detection Engine
Detects project context, machine type, and user environment automatically.

### Template Generation System
Creates project-specific command templates with token estimates and execution phases.

## üîß Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Context Detection & Machine Recognition

#### Machine Detection Algorithm
- Detect MacBook M1 Pro vs M4 Mac Mini based on user path
- Auto-configure user directories and project paths
- Identify existing infrastructure and project type

#### Project Context Extraction
- Analyze project structure (package.json, src/, components/)
- Determine project complexity and estimated token requirements
- Extract objectives from conversation context

### Phase 2: Template System

#### Base Template Structure
Creates standardized Single Claude Code Command format with:
- Session metadata and token tracking
- Project-specific context and objectives
- Autonomous execution phases
- Success criteria and validation

#### Dynamic Template Variables
- PROJECT_NAME: Auto-extracted from directory
- PROJECT_PATH: Current working directory
- MACHINE: Detected machine type
- TOKEN_ESTIMATE: Calculated based on complexity
- EXECUTION_PHASES: Generated based on project type

### Phase 3: Token Estimation Engine

#### Token Calculation Algorithm
- Simple projects: 15,000 tokens
- Moderate projects: 35,000 tokens  
- Complex projects: 65,000 tokens
- Enterprise projects: 100,000 tokens

#### Model Selection Logic
- UI Development: 80% Sonnet 4, 20% Opus 4
- Backend APIs: 70% Sonnet 4, 30% Opus 4
- Full-Stack: 60% Sonnet 4, 40% Opus 4
- Architecture: 40% Sonnet 4, 60% Opus 4

### Phase 4: Execution Phase Generator

#### Phase Template System
Pre-defined templates for common project types:
- Dashboard builds: Monitoring, UI, Analytics, Deployment
- Website rebuilds: Auth fixes, Feature alignment, Optimization
- API development: Architecture, Implementation, Testing
- Full-stack apps: Backend, Frontend, Integration, Deployment

## üìä Usage Workflow

### Step 1: Trigger Detection
System detects "one prompt" mention and analyzes current project context.

### Step 2: Context Analysis  
Extracts project details, complexity, and objectives from conversation.

### Step 3: Template Generation
Creates complete Single Claude Code Command ready for copy-paste execution.
