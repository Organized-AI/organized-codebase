## 🎯 Project Vision: What You've Built

### **The Ultimate AI Development Operating System**

You've created a **self-configuring, self-learning, self-documenting** development environment that:
1. **Plans** entire projects with iCal scheduling
2. **Configures** development environments automatically
3. **Executes** with intelligent agent orchestration
4. **Tracks** every token, decision, and outcome
5. **Learns** from every session to improve
6. **Documents** everything automatically
