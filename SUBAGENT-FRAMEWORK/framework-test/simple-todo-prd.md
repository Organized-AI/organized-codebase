- **Edit Tasks**: Modify task title and description inline

### 2. Data Persistence  
- **Local Storage**: Save all tasks to browser local storage
- **Auto-Save**: Automatic saving on every change
- **Data Recovery**: Load tasks on app startup

### 3. User Interface
- **Single Page**: All functionality on one screen
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Visual States**: Clear distinction between completed/pending tasks

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Stack
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React hooks for state management
- Local storage API for persistence

### Component Architecture
- TaskList: Main container component
- TaskItem: Individual task display and edit

### Data Schema
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  completed: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

## User Experience Requirements

### Core User Flows
1. **Add Task**: Click input → type title → press Enter → task appears
2. **Complete Task**: Click checkbox → task marked complete with strikethrough
3. **Edit Task**: Click task title → inline edit → save on Enter/blur
4. **Delete Task**: Hover task → delete button appears → click → confirm → removed

### Error Handling
- Empty task title validation
- Local storage quota exceeded
- Network offline state (future)

## Success Criteria
- All CRUD operations work smoothly
- Data persists across browser sessions  
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes
- Accessible to keyboard and screen reader users
- Clean, intuitive interface requiring no explanation

This PRD is designed to test the subagent framework's ability to create a complete, working application from requirements to implementation.
