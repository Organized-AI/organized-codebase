# Test Project: Simple Task Manager

## Initial Feature Request

I want to build a simple task management web application with the following core features:

### Core Features:
- **Task Creation**: Users can add new tasks with title and description
- **Task Management**: Mark tasks as complete/incomplete, edit task details
- **Task Organization**: Basic categorization (work, personal, shopping)
- **Task Persistence**: Save tasks to local storage for now (MVP)
- **Simple UI**: Clean, responsive interface that works on mobile and desktop

### User Experience:
- Single page application with intuitive interface
- Quick task addition without complex forms
- Visual distinction between completed and pending tasks
- Ability to filter tasks by category and status

### Technical Requirements:
- Modern React with TypeScript
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Local storage for data persistence (MVP level)
- Clean component architecture for future expansion
- Basic error handling and validation

This is intended as a test project to validate our subagent framework workflow.
