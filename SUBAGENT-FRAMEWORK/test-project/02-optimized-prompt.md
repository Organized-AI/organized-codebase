# Optimized Prompt for Task Manager PRD

## Prompt for PRD Creator

Create a comprehensive PRD for a Simple Task Management web application with the following specifications:

### CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
- **Task CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete tasks with title, description, category, and completion status
- **Category Management**: Pre-defined categories (work, personal, shopping) with ability to filter and organize tasks
- **Status Management**: Toggle completion status with visual feedback and status-based filtering
- **Data Persistence**: Local storage implementation for MVP with clear data schema for future database migration

### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- **Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS utility-first approach with responsive design patterns
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useReducer) for local state, custom hooks for shared logic
- **Architecture**: Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering with proper React patterns, minimal re-renders

### USER EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS:
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach supporting phones, tablets, and desktop
- **Intuitive Interface**: Single-page application with clear navigation and task management flows
- **Quick Actions**: Rapid task creation, completion toggling, and editing without page refreshes
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear distinction between completed/pending tasks, loading states, and user actions
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### DATA REQUIREMENTS:
- **Task Schema**: id, title, description, category, completed status, created/updated timestamps
- **Local Storage**: JSON serialization with error handling and data validation
- **Migration Ready**: Data structure designed for easy transition to database storage

### ERROR HANDLING & VALIDATION:
- **Input Validation**: Required fields, character limits, sanitization
- **Error States**: User-friendly error messages for all failure scenarios
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback behavior when local storage is unavailable
- **Data Recovery**: Basic data backup and recovery mechanisms

### TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
- **Unit Testing**: Component testing with React Testing Library
- **Integration Testing**: User flow testing for core task management operations
- **Accessibility Testing**: Automated and manual accessibility validation
- **Performance Testing**: Bundle size analysis and runtime performance validation

### FUTURE EXTENSIBILITY:
- **Database Integration**: Architecture ready for backend API integration
- **User Authentication**: Component structure supporting future user management
- **Advanced Features**: Scalable design for due dates, priorities, collaboration features
- **Mobile App**: Web-first design adaptable for React Native implementation

Create a PRD that provides clear specifications for each feature, technical architecture decisions, user interaction flows, and implementation priorities suitable for development with Claude Code subagents. Focus on creating an MVP that demonstrates the subagent framework while being production-ready in its core functionality.
